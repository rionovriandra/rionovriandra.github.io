							<h2 class="major">NHTSA 2021 Traffic Accidents Data Analysis</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This project assignment is the group task that I have to complete after finishing three modules in my data analytics course at Refocus Indonesia. In this project, I am working with four other individuals as a team. Our task is to analyze the factors causing traffic accidents in the United States using data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2021. The objective is to gain insights and provide recommendations that can be implemented in their future systems to reduce traffic accident rates.</p>
							<p>For this project, I utilized a combination of PostgreSQL to explore and discover insights from the data, and Google Spreadsheets to create data visualizations.</p>

							<h2 class="major">The Look E-Commerce Products Sales Analysis</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My first notable case study as a Data Analyst, and it serves as an assignment project for the Refocus Data Analytics Course. I will analyze a fictional company named The Look E-Commerce: a company focuses on selling fashion to various countries through an app, where the marketing division is currently planning to enhance sales through advertisements. In order to determine the most effective advertising approach, various analyses need to be conducted and supporting data must be prepared to enable the Marketing Division to make informed decisions. As assigned by the manager, I have been tasked with assisting the marketing team in preparing the necessary data and conducting analyses that will aid the division in determining the appropriate advertisements.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Performance Evaluation Analysis of Marketing & Operational Team</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/SQL3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I will once again analyze the same dataset as before from The Look E-Commerce company, as part of the assignment project for the Refocus Data Analytics Course. The difference is that this time I will analyze the key results requested by the Manager, which will be the benchmark for the team’s and company’s success, and I am asked to make recommendations that will be used for the next quarter. These key results cover the marketing and operations divisions of The Look E-Commerce.</p>
